                <p>This is required for icat to see the new authenticator. As any earlier version of this authenticator will have
                    been removed then it
                    is important to perform this next step promptly.

                <p>
                    If you still have the installation directory for icat then edit the icat.properties to refer to the new authenticator and type:
                    <tt>./setup install</tt>
                    Otherwise edit the icat.properties file in the config directory for your domain and restart the glassfish domain.

            <subsection name="Check that authn_shibboleth works">
                <p>Use testicat (which is installed with ICAT) for someone with a Shibboleth account.
                    It should report that it logs in, but may or may not have
                    the permission to run the rest of the test.
                    If it does not report that it has logged in then please check the server.log and the
                    authn_shibboleth.log files which can both be
                    found in the logs directory below your domain.
