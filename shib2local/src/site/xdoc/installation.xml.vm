                        application.
                        Testing has been carried out with Glassfish 3.1.2.

            <subsection name="Update the icat.properties file for your ICAT">
                <p>This is required for icat to see the new authenticator. As any earlier version of this authenticator will have
                    been removed then it
                    is important to perform this next step promptly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you still have the installation directory for icat then edit the icat.properties to refer to the new authenticator and type:
                    <tt>./setup install</tt>
                    Otherwise edit the icat.properties file in the config directory for your domain and restart the glassfish domain.

            <subsection name="Add user mappings">Users should be added to the database table ACCOUNTIDMAP. This has
                two columns, one for the EAAHash value and
                one for the ICAT username to map it onto. The table may be manually edited. It is expected that a facility will provide a web based
                mechanism to authenticate simultaneously to Shibboleth and to something that guarantees his ICAT user name and then put an entry
                in the
                table.
            </subsection>

            <subsection name="Check that authn_shib2local works">
                <p>Use testicat (which is installed with ICAT) for someone with a Shibboleth account and for which a mapping has
                    been provided in the
                    database ACCOUNTIDMAP table. It should report that it logs in, but may or may not have
                    the permission to run the rest of the test.
                    If it does not report that it has logged in then please check the server.log and the
                    authn_shib2local.log files which can both be
                    found in the logs directory below your domain.
